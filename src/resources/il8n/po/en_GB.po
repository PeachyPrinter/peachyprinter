"[b]Laser Safety[/b]\n"
"\n"
"The Peachy Printer uses a UV laser to cure the resin.  This laser is "
"powerful enough to damage your eyesight.  As a user you agree that you will "
"take the following precautions to ensure the safety of yourself and those "
"around you:\n"
" - Never give the laser light any opportunity to shine on your skin or "
"eyes.\n"
" - Always ensure when operating the printer, that it is in an enclosure "
"which prevents all laser light from escaping.\n"
" - Never look directly into the laser (even when using the UV glasses).\n"
" - Be aware that the UV blocking glasses included do not guarantee your "
"safety.\n"
" - Do not remove the aperture from the laser module.\n"
" - Remove any pets or young children from the room.\n"
" - Install and use the UV filtering safeguards on the printer.\n"
" - Do not pick the printer up while the laser is turned on.\n"
" - Ensure that your enclosure window is not faded scratched or damaged in "
"any way\n"
" - Resin can damage the UV blocking materials we have sent you.  If resin "
"comes in contact with these materials replace them immediately.\n"
"\n"
"[b]Resin Safety[/b]\n"
"\n"
"The resin that Peachy Printer uses is a mild skin irritant.  Some people may "
"have reactions to it if it makes direct contact with their skin.  It cures "
"under UV light, and if exposed to direct sunlight can actually cure at a "
"dangerous rate causing it to heat and possibly shatter.\n"
"You must read and understand the MSDS that pertains to the resin you are "
"using.If you have received resin from peachy printer, note that this Resin "
"is a Maker Juice Product, refer to Maker Juice for MSDS information.\n"
"In addition to instructions contained in the MSDS, you agree to take the "
"following precautions to ensure the safety of yourself and those around "
"you:\n"
"\n"
" - Keep away from children and animals.\n"
" - Use protective gloves when handling.\n"
" - Wear protective safety glasses (The UV blocking glasses are not adequate "
"safety glasses) when handling.\n"
" - Be extra careful to keep away from skin and clothing.\n"
" - Do not drink or ingest it.\n"
" - Store in a cool dark place.\n"
" - Do not expose to direct sunlight.\n"
" - Use in a well ventilated area.\n"
"\n"
"[b]Product Functionality[/b]\n"
"\n"
"As the Peachy Printer Kit is constructed by the user, Peachy Printer Inc."
"does not guarantee any amount of functionality.\n"
"\n"
"By building any part of the kit or installing any part of the software you "
"agree that Peachy Printer Inc. is not liable for injuries or damages from "

"Each of these test patterns may be useful in understanding various aspects "

"interest:\n"
"\n"
"[b]Hourglass[/b] - The hourglass is very good for testing for hysteresis if "
"you play this pattern slowly (below 50mm/second) the laser should come to "
"the exact center of the hourglass 2 times per layer.  If your printer has "
"hysteresis the 2 centre points of the hourglass will not overlap, the will "
"be misaligned.\n"
"\n"
"[b]NSEW[/b] - If you picked the correct shape in the orientation section "
"then this pattern should draw NSEW the same way you would look at a map.\n"
"\n"
"[b]Twitch[/b] - Playing this pattern along with the speed adjuster can help "
"you learn things \n"
"about the resonant frequency of each mirror\n"
"\n"
"[b]Damping[/b] - This can help you see the effects of the slew rate caused "
"by the dampening on your printer.\n"
"\n"
"\n"
"[b]Hilbert[/b] - This pattern is useful in seeing how linear the printer’s "
"output is, \n"
"and if the printer has the same ability to turn a sharp corner in all areas "
"of the print.\n"
"\n"
"[b]Spiral[/b] - We find this very helpful in finding an irregular spot in "
"your mirror movement \n"
"such as would be caused if the damper magnets were physically touching the "
"aluminum slug on one of your mirrors."
